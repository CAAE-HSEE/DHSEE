3. How to run this code
The implemented code of our DHSEE approach can be found in the file of DHSEE.py.  
If you want to run other versions of DHSEE such as DHSEE- or DHSEE*, you can select it according to the 2.  Description of the files and folders.
There are several parameters you should pay attention such as data_set_name, batch_size and validation_patience_original.
There are some feasible parameters：
